# Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Extensions



## About

Looking for some useful Orchard extensions? Here's a bundle solution of all of Lombiq's open-source Orchard extensions (modules and themes). Clone and try them out!

This is an [Orchard CMS](https://www.orchardcore.net/orchardcms) Visual Studio solution that contains most of [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com)'s open-source Orchard modules and themes, as well as related utilities and libraries. Since the extensions are included as git submodules when cloning this repo set git to initialize submodules.
